Intuition is the means by which cognition relates to objects

Sensibility is the capacity to acquire representations by the way's we're affected by objects

Sensation is the effect on an object on the capacity for representation insofar as we're affected by it

Matter is that in the appearence which corresponds to sensation, appearence being the undeterminend object of an empirical intuition

The form of the appeance is that which allows the manifold of appeances to be intuited in ordered in certain relations (A bit confused on this, remember to ask questions later)

The transcendental aesthetic is the science of all principles of a priori sensibility (Science here meaning a systematic body of knowledge)

# Transcendetal Aesthetic

Objects are given to us by the means of Sensibility

> "Objects are therefore given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone affords us intuitions; but they are thought through the understanding, and from it arise concepts."

Was confused on the meaning, I think this means that intuitions are thought through by understanding and from thinking through these intuitions we arise to concepts. Makes sense to me.


Since the only way objects are given to us is through sensibility, and sensibility is what affords us intuitions, thought must be connected to sensibility as it is connected to intuitions.

Intuitions that are related to an object through sensation are Empirical, the undeterminded object of an empirical intuition is called appearance.

Question: What is meant by "undeterminded"?

The matter of all appearence is only given to us a posteriori but its form lies in the mind a priori. 

Kant calls all representations pure insofar nothing ecountered within the  representation belongs to sensation. As such the pure forms of sensible intuitions are found to be in the mind a priori

> This pure form of sensibility itself is also called pure intuition. So if I separate from the representation of a body that which the understanding thinks about it, such as substance, force, divisibility, etc., as well as that which belongs to sensation, such as impenetrability, hardness, color, etc., something from this empirical intuition is still left for me, namely extension and form. These belong to the pure intuition, which occurs a priori, even without an actual object of the senses or sensation, as a mere form of sensibility in the mind.

In the transcendetal aesthetic, Kant seeks to isolate sensibility by removing everything the understanding thinks through its concepts, leaving empirical intuition. He will then go on to remove everything that belongs to sensation from empirical intuition to isolate pure intuition and the mere forms of appeances, the only thing that sensibility can make available a priori. Kant claims that after this we come to find two pure forms of sensibile intuition as principles of a priori cognition, Space and Time.

# The Transcendental Aesthetic First Section "On space"

Through outer sense (a property of our mind) we represent objects as outside of us and in space. In space the objects form, magnitude, and relation to one another are determined or determinable.

Inner sense (is inner sense a property of our mind aswell?) by means of the mind intuiting itself, gives no intuition of the soul (What is meant by the soul? Does he simply mean conciousness? Needs further elaboration) itself itself as an object yet it still a determinate form (What is meant by being a determinate form? Is the soul a determinate form or is inner sense a determine form?). 

Everything that belongs to inner determinations is represented in relations of time. Time can no more be intuited externally than space can be intuited as something in us.

It seems to me as if there's a relation between Time and Inner sense as opposed to Space and Outer sense

Time ⇔ Inner Sense?
Space ⇔ Outer Sense?

(Note: Not a biconditional in the Prop Logic sense, just meant to demonstrate the connection between them)

We set out do determine whether or not space and time are actual entities are only determinations or relations of things, amongst other possible hypothesis.

We consider Space in this section:

Kant asserts that Space isn't an empirical concept drawn from outer experience, as for sensations to relate to things outside of me (as in relating to something is another place then where I find myself) and as such represent them as not mearly different but in different places the representation of space must already be their ground. As such we cannot obtain the representation for space from the relations of outer appearence through experience, because the outer experience is itself only possible through this representation.

As established space is a necessary representation a priori which grounds all outer intuitions. It is regarded as the condition for the possibility of appeances, not as a determination dependent on them.

The apodictic (meaning clearly established or beyond dispute) certainty of geometric principles and the possbility of their apriori construction are grounded in the apriori necessity (of space I assume). This is because if the representation of space were acquires a posteriori the first principles of mathematical determination would be nothing but perception and as such would be as contingent as perception. It wouldn't be necessary that there exists only one straight line between two points, simply that experience always teaches us. (Why is this a problem?) What is borrowed from experience has comparative universlity, namely through induction (Oh that's why it's a problem).

Kant further asserts that space is not a discursive general concepts of relations of things in general (What does this mean??) but a pure intuition.

Kant further argues that all geometrical principles (like for example that in a triangle two sides together are always greater than the third) are not derived from general concepts of line and triangle, but rather are derived from intuition a priori with apodictic certainty.

(Side Note: The Geometrical Principles Kant discusses seem to only apply to Euclidean Geometry)

Kane claims Space is represented as a given infinite magnitude and asserts that if there were not boundlessness in the progress of intuition no concept of relations could bring with it a principle of their infinity.

# Conclusions from the Above Concepts

Space doesn't represent a property of things in themselves nor a relation of them.

Space is nothing other than merely the form of all appearances of outer sense, i.e, the subjective condition of sensibility under which all outer intuition is possible.

We can speak of space, extended beings, ect only from the human standpoint. If we depart from the subjective condition under which alone can acquire outer intuitions then the representation of space signifies nothing at all. The constant form of receptivity, what we call sensibility, is a necessary condition of all relations within which objects can be intuited as outside us and if we abstact these objects we obtain the pure intuition which is named "Space".

Kant asserts that his expositions teach the reality of space in regard to everything we see externally to us as an object, but at the same time the ideality of space in regard to things when they are considered in themselves through reason, i.e, without taking account of the constitution of our sensibility. Kant asserts the empirical reality of space with respect to all possible outer experience but at the same time asserts its transcendental ideality, taking space as the grounds of the thing in themselves.

Space is the only subjective representation related to something external that we can call a priori objective. Things like taste and colors are by no means necessary conditions under which alone the objects can be objects of the senses for us, they are combined with the appeance as contingently added effects of the particular organization, and as such are not a priori representations but grounded in sensation.
