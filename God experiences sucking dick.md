# Starting Premises

* P1.) If something can be known, anything that is a God knows it (i,e the Omniscience premise)
* P2.) The experience of sucking dick can be known
* P3.) There exists the experience of sucking dick
* P4.) God Exists

```
P1.) ∀x(Gx ⇒ ∀y(Cy ⇒ Kxy)) | Premise
P2.) ∀z(Sz ⇒ Cz) | Premise
P3.) ∃x(Sx) | Premise
P4.) ∃w(Gw) | Premise
P5.) Sb | EI, 3
P6.) Sb ⇒ Cb | UI, 2
P7.) Cb | Modus Ponens, 5, 6
P8.) ∀x(Gx ⇒ Cb ⇒ Kxb)) | UI, 1
P9.) Ge | EI, 4
P10.) Ge ⇒ Cb ⇒ Keb | UI, 10
P11.) Cb ⇒ Keb | Modus Ponens, 9, 10
C.) Keb | Modus Ponens, 7, 11
```
# Conclusion in Natural Language

Let e be God and b be the experience of sucking dick, if so e knows b. Meaning God knows the experience of sucking dick.

# Possible counters

* The argument is deductively valid in Classical Predicate Logic, if you wish to deny the conclusion you can just deny Classical Predicate Logic
* You can deny that God is Omniscient (premise one), or you can define omniscient to mean something other then knowing all things that can be known.
* You can deny the experience of sucking dick can be known or that the experience even exists though this seems absurd.
* You can deny that God exists
* You can disagree with how I've formalized these premises though I don't think that will be very fruitful.

**NOTE:** Premise 3 and 4 ontologically commits us to God and that experience however even if we don't assert these premises it's possible to derive:

```
∀x(Gx ⇒ ∀y(Sy ⇒ Kxy))
```
Which in natural language translates to:

Anything that is a God knows any experience of sucking dick

So it is possible to derive a desirable conclusion without giving an argument that ontologically commits us to God. (Though I think Quine would still argue that we're ontologically commited by quantifying.) Thanks to @Blakaligula for catching this.
