# Assumptions 

List of assumptions made when dealing with the principle of sufficient reason

* The Principle of Sufficient Reason this arguement considers is the following: any plurality of contingent truths has a full ground
* If some facts Fs collectively ground some facts Gs, then necessarily, if each fact among Fs obtains, then each fact among Gs obtains
* A plurality of truths are contingently true if and only if at least one of them is contingently true
* A plurality of truths are necessarily true if and only if each of them is necessarily true.
* Cs refers to all contingent truths, not the set of them but all of them at the same time
* Cs successfully refers since there is at least one contingent truth
* any plurality of truths with at least one contingent truth among them are contingent
* General Irreflexivity (GI): for any Xs and Ys, if Xs and Ys overlap, then Xs are not the full ground of Ys

P1. There is at least one contingent truth
P2. Let ‘Cs’ collectively denote the contingent truths
P3. Cs are contingent
P4. So Cs have a sufficient reason, Rs
P5. Rs are either contingent or necessary
P6. If Rs are necessary, then Cs are necessary, since grounding induces entailment.
P7. If Rs are contingent, they are either disjoint or overlap Cs
P8. If they are disjoint, Rs would be necessary so they cannot be disjoint with Cs and contingent
P9. If Rs are contingent, they either just are Cs or Rs overlaps Cs
P10. If Rs just are Cs, they cannot be the full ground of Cs
P11. If Rs are contingent, they overlap Cs
P12. By GI, If Rs are contingent, they do are not the full ground of Cs
P13. That would contradict Rs being the sufficient reason of Cs
P14. Rs cannot be contingent
P15. Rs are necessary
P16. Cs are necessary
C. All contingent truths are necessary
